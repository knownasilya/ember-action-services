ember-action-services
=====================

Action services contain immutable state and actions that mutate that state

ðŸ’¡ If you have ideas for the direction of this addon, please open an issue. I'd love to hear your thoughts!

Installation
------------

```
ember install ember-action-services
```


Usage
-----

Action services let you share actions and state across multiple components and controller/template combos in a safe way.

An action service defines immutable state, which can only be modified by calling `setState` on that service. The developer then creates actions on that service, and modify the state using `setState`. Note that async actions work using `async/await`.

### Setup Action Service

Create a new service using `ember g service <name>`. Then modify the created
file to look something like this:

```js
import { ActionService } from 'ember-action-services';

export default ActionService.extend({
  /*
    This is optional, but if not set the default state is an empty object.
    This could also be the place you bring back state from localStorage or something similar.
  */
  initState() {
    return {
      test: {
        name: 'hi'
      }
    };
  },
  
  actions: {
    duplicate() {
      /*
        `pluckState` is provided by ActionService and takes 1 or more keys as arguments, e.g. `this.pluckState('cloneUser', 'test')` will return  `{ cloneUser, test }` object.
      */
      let { cloneUser } = this.pluckState('cloneUser');

      cloneUser = cloneUser ? cloneUser + 1 : 1;

      /*
        `setState` is also provided by ActionService and takes an object that is merged with the existing state.
      */
      this.setState({ cloneUser });
    },
    
    setName() {
      this.setState({
        test: {
          name: 'good bye'
        }
      });
    }
  }
});
```

Not the use of `ActionService` rather then the default `Ember.Service`.

### Using Action Service

To call actions on an action service, you would first inject
that service where you need it. For example:

```js
import Component from '@ember/component';
import { inject as service } from '@ember/service';

export default Component.extend({
  userStateService: service('user-state')
});
```

Then you can use that service in your template:

```hbs
<button type='button' onclick={{action 'duplicate' target=userStateService}}>Duplicate User</button>
```

To access state data, you can do so via normal Ember conventions under the `state` path under that service, e.g.

```hbs
User was cloned {{userStateService.state.cloneUser}} times.
```
